left off:

-weapon reload time works but might be a bit buggy
-weapon visual referense of realoading and ammo capacity
-weapon needs to be able to add recoil to the character node

-make different projectile types

random seed in BG generation

need to do a typewritter like effect on large bg, so that character is near origin when entering zones.
 -maybe look at a zone manager, that does some of that for me

 more procedural bg generation algos

 start adding in some cool lighting effects
 procedural ship
 with lights along the geometry.

---------

big picture:
ship can have pick ups that effects its flight speed, changes its over all look
-wings
-rockets
-etc

-rougelike elements

-how do we deal with enemy movement
