left off:

weapons system:

-weapon needs to be looked at.. 
	-shotgun effect
	-if you release during reload, you should be able to resume firing, maybe
	-reload button
		-waiting to automatically reload, reloads slower. manual reload reloads faster
-projectile material needs a position offset per projectile so the noise isnt so uniform for follow up projectiles
-projectile explosion on impact
-new projectile lightning

-sheild
-reflective shield
-bust through things with your ship

random seed in BG generation

need to do a typewritter like effect on large bg, so that character is near origin when entering zones.
 -maybe look at a zone manager, that does some of that for me

 more procedural bg generation algos

 start adding in some cool lighting effects
 procedural ship
 with lights along the geometry.

---------

big picture:
ship can have pick ups that effects its flight speed, changes its over all look
-wings
-rockets
-etc

-rougelike elements

-how do we deal with enemy movement
