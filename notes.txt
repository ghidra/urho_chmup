left off:

why do I have to have animatedmodle, insetad of staticmodel to compile in obstacle

random seed in BG generation
make obstacles "explode" or dissapear for now

need to do a typewritter like effect on large bg, so that character is near origin when entering zones.
 -maybe look at a zone manager, that does some of that for me

 more procedural bg generation algos

 start adding in some cool lighting effects
 procedural ship
 with lights along the geometry.

add some pickups in the scene
-specifically weapon pickups

---------

big picture:
ship can have pick ups that effects its flight speed, changes its over all look
-wings
-rockets
-etc

-rougelike elements

-how do we deal with enemy movement
