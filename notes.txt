left off:

add some pickups in the scene
-specifically weapon pickups

-make lots of weapons
-make lots of projectile types
-i think that I am going to have one weapon, that pickups can effect.
-it will give the weapon the logic
	-ie rotation speed (sin rotation)
	-number of projectiles at once
	-fire rate

random seed in BG generation

need to do a typewritter like effect on large bg, so that character is near origin when entering zones.
 -maybe look at a zone manager, that does some of that for me

 more procedural bg generation algos

 start adding in some cool lighting effects
 procedural ship
 with lights along the geometry.

---------

big picture:
ship can have pick ups that effects its flight speed, changes its over all look
-wings
-rockets
-etc

-rougelike elements

-how do we deal with enemy movement
